# ChatGPT

All the code in this folder is generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

## Format

At the start of each file there'll be a comment like this  
```
# This code has been generated with OpenAi's ChatGPT AI with the input
# 
# <input>
```

There might be some modifications that i did to the thread (excluding continue) and they'll be written like this:
```
# <the input from before>
# 
# <eventual second input>
#
# <eventual third input>
#
# <and so on>
```

## Fixed Folder

The fixed folder has all the fixed code (if need) of the ai produced code, since sometimes it has some problems
